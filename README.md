Team Grape Crush ZenoJam 2022 Submission "Uva comminuet deum"
Andrew Mao, Alex Mei, Dorson Tang 2022 ZenoJam Submission inspired by Deep Rock Galactic. :)

Across 7 days, Team Grape Crush learned the process of game making from scratch to completion with the Unity Game Engine. 
Programming, pixel art, and music were custom made with a few exceptions.

Fork and remix the program to your hears content! Let us know if you have any questions with the design and enjoy!
